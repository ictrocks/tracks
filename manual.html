<h2>INPUT GUIDE</h2>
<p> NOTE: ALL INPUT FIELDS MUST BE FILLED</p>
<p> The application will estimate the sizing of a specific PV and Batteries<br>
and the minimum specifications for inverter and charge controller<br>
necessary to satisfy the load demand given the solar irradiation<br>
and days of autonomy of the system<br>

<h3>For Load Demand</h3>
<p>
The user may directly input the total load parameters<br>
or may input the appliances one by one, to do the latter<br>
press <b>Add Appliances and Ratings</b>.
</p>

<h3>For Charge Controller</h3>
<p>
The user must input operating voltage of the PV system, this is <br>
usually 12 V or 24 V. For Efficiency, it accounts the losses on <br>
the battery, cables and the charge controller itself. Its value <br>
ranges from 70% to 90%, but typically 85% (0.85) <br>
</p>


<h3>Sun Hours</h3>
<p>
The sun-hours can be determined with an insolation map.<br>

</p>

<h3>Inverter</h3>
<p>
The inverter specifications assumes to be compliant<br>
with the operating voltage. For efficiency, it can be<br>
set to 0.9.
</p>

<h3>For PV and Batteries</h3>
<p>
Please refer to the datasheet.
</p>

<p>
Once the parameters are set, press <b>Initialize</b> to calculate<br>
the PV system sizing parameters and specifications that will be shown below.
